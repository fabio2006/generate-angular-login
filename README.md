generate-angular-login
======================

This project was inspired by two different open source projects, [yeoman/generator-angular]( https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular) and [mrgamer/angular-login-example](https://github.com/mrgamer/angular-login-example) it combines both projects into a template site which have registration, login and multi-roles authentication. I also made some modifications on it so that the grunt tasks could run without errors.


##Installation
```
$ git clone https://github.com/guohuang/generate-angular-login.git
$ cd generate-angular-login
$ npm install && bower install && grunt

```
